# Nanovoltmeter
A low noise nanovoltmeter design files and code

The design includes five boards:
1. The nanovoltmeter main board
2. A SMPS daughter board to downconvert the battery voltage to the various power rails used in the design
3. A battery board with BMS for 4S 21700 cells
4. A rear panel board with battery charger
5. A front panel

This repository will also include the source code for the STM32U575 microcontroller that interfaces with the various peripherals.
